<h1>HTML</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/" target="_blank" title="html5 specification">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</a>
    is the standard markup language for 
    <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web applications.
    Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render 
    them into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally 
    included cues for the appearance of the document.

    With HTML constructs, images and other objects, such as interactive forms, may be embedded into 
    the rendered page. 
    It provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics 
    for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. 
    HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. </p>
